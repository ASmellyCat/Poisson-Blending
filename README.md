# Poisson-Blending

# Introduction
Poisson Blending is a technique employed to seamlessly blend images. The principle behind this method is to maintain the structure of the source image while adapting the colors to that of the target.

Least square error:

• Blue channel: Least square error: 3.47e-12

• Green channel: Least square error: 3.20e-12

• Red channel: Least square error: 3.27e-12

## Conclusion
Poisson Blending showcased how we can seamlessly integrate elements from different images, leading to harmonious and natural results. Employing the least square error metric was instrumental in quantifying the accuracy and success of our techniques.
